#  Infrared-3Camera Core
## Custom infrared and multi-webcam sensor modules in Javascript and Lyoko for AugR core functionality

The modules that comprise this core package contain functionality for capturing photosensor data for use in decentralized immersive applications or DIAs. These DIAs are written in natural language via an interface called Lyoko which can synthesize machine and natural human instructions opening up a new realm of design phenomena.

#  MOTIVATION
To produce a truly immersive interactive experiences for users and developers in the pARk, one's hands must interact with objects and spaces in the serialization in such a manner as to be indiscernible from analogous interactions in the baseline "real world".
